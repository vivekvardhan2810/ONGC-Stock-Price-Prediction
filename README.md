# ONGC-Stock-Price-Prediction
This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices of ONGC using three machine learning models: LSTM, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Each model is evaluated based on its performance in predicting stock prices using various metrics, including RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
